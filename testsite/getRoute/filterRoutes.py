#This script takes an expanded GTFS file and generates a new file,
#route_shapes.json, that contains one geojson MultiLineString for each
#entry in the GTFS routes.txt table. This represents the map shape for
#each route, including possible variations/line branches/etc, simplified
#using the Douglas-Peucker algorithm for a minimal resulting file size.

#Approach:
#For each route,
#1 - Get the set of shapes corresponding to the route;
#2 - Select the longest shape (with the most coordinate pairs);
#3 - Draw a buffer around this longest shape;
#4 - For each remaining shape,
#a - Remove points from the shape within the buffered area,
#b - Add the remaining shape to the longest shape as an additional
#    LineString in the MultiLineString

#Run this from within a directory containing the GTFS csv files.

#pandas lets us use data frames to load and store the GTFS tables
import pandas as pd
#geojson lets us construct and dump geojson objects
import geojson as gj
#shapely lets us manipulate geometric objects
import shapely.geometry as sh


#Read relevant GTFS tables to pandas dataframes
stops = pd.read_csv('stops.txt')
shapes = pd.read_csv('shapes.txt')

#Join routes table to trips table on route_id

#Join this table to shapes on shape_id
routes_trips_shapes = pd.merge(routes_trips, shapes, on='shape_id',
    how='inner')

#Now we want to get rid of all the columns we don't need
#These are the ones we want:
